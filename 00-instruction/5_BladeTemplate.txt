We can use @include('viewname'); to add another view to our current page


We can use script tags in view
   
    {{ $users }} //is a variable within the template
   
   <script >
      var data= @json($users);
      console.log(data);
   </script>


@csrf
generates a token and we can use it to authenticate user by knowing if its a request from within our site or not

We can apply style with the style tags
